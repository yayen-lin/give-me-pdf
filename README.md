## Give Me PDF

### Motivation

I think there are times when we need to read or study on some text file (e.g. .pdf, .ppt). There are also times when we want to quickly memorize some technical terms to understand what we have just read (say, you're preparing for a test). To me, typing while reading helps me do better at quickly grabbing some quick memorization.

### What is Give-Me-PDF

Give-Me-PDF is a typing speed app where it allows users to:

- upload/paste a text file or texts to practice and improve words-per-minute (wpm) and accuracy while reading through the file a user uploads
- see the progress over time with our self-designed charts.
- randomly generate texts if a user does not upload a text file

### Scalable Parts

- users should be able to practice writing codes on this web app too
  - for example, generates code like leetcode problems for users to practice while typing
- collect words or a certain sequence of letters that are most frequently typed wrong
  - these data could be collected for other purposes
  - to train a word processing software
- files uploaded should be discarded or securely kept.
